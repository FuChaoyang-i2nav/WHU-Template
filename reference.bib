ABSTRACT = {Traditional magnetic-field positioning methods collect magnetic-field information from each spatial point to construct a magnetic-field fingerprint database. During the positioning phase, real-time magnetic-field measurements are matched to a magnetic-field map to predict the user’s location. However, this approach requires a significant amount of time to traverse the entire magnetic-field fingerprint database and does not effectively leverage the magnetic-field sequence’s unique patterns to improve the accuracy and robustness of the positioning system. In recent years, the application of deep learning for the indoor positioning of magnetic fields has grown rapidly, especially by using the magnetic-field sequence as a time series and a trained long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict the position, directly avoiding the time-consuming matching process. However, the training of LSTM is time-consuming, and the degradation problem occurs as the stack of layers increases. This article proposes a temporal convolutional network (TCN)-based magnetic-field positioning system that extracts magnetic-field sequence features by preprocessing them with coordinate transformation, smoothing filtering, and first-order differencing. The proposed method is seamlessly applicable to heterogeneous smartphones. The trained TCN models are compared with the LSTM and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models, showing the high accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {Fine-grained localization is extremely important to accurately locate a user indoors. Although innovative solutions have already been proposed, there is no solution that is universally accepted, easily implemented, user centric, and, most importantly, works in the absence of GSM coverage or WiFi availability. The advent of sensor rich smartphones has paved a way to develop a solution that can cater to these requirements.By employing a smartphone's built-in magnetic field sensor, magnetic signatures were collected inside buildings. These signatures displayed a uniqueness in their patterns due to the presence of different kinds of pillars, doors, elevators, etc., that consist of ferromagnetic materials like steel or iron. We theoretically analyze the cause of this uniqueness and then present an indoor localization solution by classifying signatures based on their patterns. However, to account for user walking speed variations so as to provide an application usable to a variety of users, we follow a dynamic time-warping-based approach that is known to work on similar signals irrespective of their variations in the time axis.Our approach resulted in localization distances of approximately 2m--6m with accuracies between 80--100\% implying that it is sufficient to walk short distances across hallways to be located by the smartphone. The implementation of the application on different smartphones yielded response times of less than five secs, thereby validating the feasibility of our approach and making it a viable solution.},

abstract = {The use of smartphones for indoor positioning has become increasingly popular in recent years. The cumulative error is an unavoidable problem for pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR). Mismatching is the main problem for fingerprint matching. Therefore, how to integrate multiple sensors to reduce the position error and improve the robustness of the positioning system is a subject worthy of further research. For fingerprint matching, an enhanced dynamic time warping (EDTW) is proposed to improve the accuracy of magnetic field matching. For PDR/magnetic matching (MM)/WiFi, a multi-source fusion positioning approach based on a robust extended Kalman filter (REKF) that introduces the estimation of the innovation sequence covariance is studied. The PDR-based error model is taken as the state transition equation and the difference between PDR and MM and the difference between PDR and WiFi as the observation equation. The experimental results show that the multi-source fusion positioning approach not only reduces the position error but also improves the robustness.}
